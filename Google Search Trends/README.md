I created this project as part of the course "100 Days of Coding: The Complete Python Bootcamp". 

Google Trends gives estimates of search volume. In this project I explored if search popularity relates to other kinds of data.

This project was built in Jupyter Notebook, it entails Data Exploration, Data Cleaning and Data Visualization.

<h1>Maven Rail Challenge</h1>
<p> I created this Dashboard to participate in the Maven Rail Challenge in May/June 2024. </p>
<p>The clean data set was provided along with some pointers of what the dashboard is supposed to visualize.</p>
<p> The goal of this dashboard was to visualize the following:
<ul>
  <li>Most popular routes</li>
  <li>Peak travel times</li>
  <li>Revenue</li>
  <li>On-time performance and contributing factors</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The Month and Departure Station filters allow us to drill deeper into the stats.</p>

<p>For example, selecting Edinburgh Waverley as Departure Station shows, that there is only one route from Edinburgh Waverley to London Kings Cross. All trains on this route were delayed due to staffing and a refund was requested for all tickets issued. This means that this route is not generating any net revenue.</p>

<p>Furthermore, selecting Oxford as Departure Station shows that the Oxford to Bristol Temple Meads route was 100% delayed at 2 pm (11.63% of overall performance) due to signal failure. Selecting the single months shows, that this issue was present every month. Fixing the signal issue on this route could lead to fewer delays and therefore fewer refunds requested and more net revenue.</p>

<p><span style="text-align: start;color: rgb(31, 35, 40);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: 16px;">I created this project as part of the course &quot;100 Days of Coding: The Complete Python Bootcamp&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span>Following the documentation and data from Dr Ignaz Semmelweis, this project shows how the physician concluded in 1847 that Handwashing has a significant effect on the Maternal Death Rate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It can be seen as an attempt how Dr Semmelweis&apos;s research and documentation could have looked like in modern days.</p>

Analysis of delivery orders from a delivery app

Original data:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedharris/restaurant-order-details

(I used https://sqlizer.io/ to convert the .xlsx files into the SQL script, an easy way as MySQL does not read .xlsx files)

With a background as Hospitality Operations Manager any restaurant-related datasets make me excited.
Questions I asked myself for this dataset:

<ul>
  <li>Which restaurants and Cuisines are the most popular?</li>
  <li>What are the average order size, price, delivery time as well as ratings?</li>
  <li>What is the busiest time of the day for food orders?</li>
  <li>Which restaurants were rated highest/lowest? Can I find reasons for the difference in ratings?</li>
</ul>
